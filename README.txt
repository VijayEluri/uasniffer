Here's a small code snippet that will analyze your agent string and put
some relevant CSS class names in your <HTML> tag:

   public service(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res)
   throws ServletException {
      String agentString = req.getHeader("user-agent");
      UserAgent       ua = Sniffer.analyze(agentString);
      res.getWriter().write("<HTML class=\"" + ua.getNamesAsString() + "\"><BODY>Hello world</BODY></HTML>");
   }
